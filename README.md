### LCD Screen Assembly Program
<a name="LCD"></a>

Here our program looks under the hood, and uses timers, interrupt, analog-to-digital conversion, and the arduino ports and registers in order to program a functioning LCD screen on the Atmel Xmega arduino using the AVR instruction set. The goal was to develop proficiency with low level hardware, operating systems, and basic computer architecture. The Assembly code can be found [here](https://github.com/NeddTheRedd/Arduino-LCD/blob/main/Arduino_program.asm). A skeleton of an assembly-language program was provided, and the bulk of the code was built, debugged, and executed by myself in Microchip Studio. 

Here is a demonstration of what the finished product was able to achieve:
